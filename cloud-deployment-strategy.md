# Cloud Deployment Strategy for ML Pipeline

## Introduction
This document outlines the deployment strategy for a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline on a cloud platform using preemptible VMs.

## Strategy Overview
The deployment strategy can be broken down into the following steps:

### 1. Configure Launch Template
- Choose an appropriate Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu or Amazon Linux) based on the cloud platform's compatibility and requirements.
- Optionally, consider using ARM architecture to save costs if your code is compatible with it.

### 2. Create Instance
- Utilize the previously configured launch template to launch preemptible VM instances.
- Select an instance type that aligns with the resource demands of the ML pipeline.
- Generate an SSH key pair for secure access to the instances.

### 3. Launch Instance
- Ensure the ML pipeline can handle interruptions gracefully by incorporating checkpointing mechanisms.

### 4. Install Docker, Kubernetes, and Argo
- Install Docker to manage containers efficiently.
- Set up Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Install Argo to manage ML workflow pipelines effectively.

### 5. Deploy Pipeline
- Assuming you have the ML pipeline ready with the necessary workflow, Dockerfile, and scripts, use Argo to deploy the pipeline on the preemptible VM instance.
- Define dependencies between pipeline stages to ensure smooth execution.
- Specify output artifact locations for easy access and storage.

### 6. Utilize External Storage (e.g., S3)
- Employ an external storage service like Amazon S3 to persistently store model parameters and other crucial artifacts generated during training.
- This will enable you to resume training from the last saved state after any instance interruption.
